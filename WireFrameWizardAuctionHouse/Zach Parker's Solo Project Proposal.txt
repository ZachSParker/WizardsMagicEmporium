Project Description: this app will be an ecommerce site for witches/wizards/magicfolk
alike, to sell magical items with different properties that they have acquired/stolen
in the long centuries they've been alive, they are able to list their product , browse
the marketplace, see their own listings, compete in a gold leaderboard, and make
offers on an object of magical prominence if they have the gold. the ability to edit
and delete their own listing will be present as well. I want to make this website
because it will push me as a developer to grow and using react+spring is a very
common combination ive seen in the industry/jobs ive been looking at.
